# Day11-of-100Days-of-Code-Python
# Blackjack

* A project developed over a few hours of hardwork which can be followed along: 100 days of Python.

The strategy for playing is:

1. When the value of dealer's revealed card is 4,5 or 6, it may be fruitful to double your bet with an Ace and 4 in hand.

2. You may want to surrender if you have 16 in your hand while the dealer has a 9,10 or A.

3. You should always split if you have a pair of Aces.

4. If you get a pair of 7s, only press hit if the dealer has 8,9,10 or Ace.
